* the configuration-first design of Hamlet lends it to integration with many tools
* the topics covered here serve to demonstrate the usage patterns and best-practices established by the hamlet-io team
* they are not a supported part of the Hamlet product

Hamlet can be easily integrated with a wide range of 3rd-party tools. The integrations covered here serve to document common usage patterns established by the Hamlet community and should be treated as examples only, useful for implementing Hamlet into your existing DevOps stack.
