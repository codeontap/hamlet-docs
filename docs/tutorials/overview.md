The following tutorials are available to guide you through creating, deploying, upgrading and automating your cloud environments. They are designed to illustrate the design of the CMDB in a gradual progression and as such they are intended to build upon the knowledge of the previous tutorials.

<Admonition type="note" title="Tutorial Providers & Frameworks">
    The tutorials explore a variety of cloud providers and their frameworks to illustrate how the CMDB structure remains the same, whilst the output is provider and framework specific. You are encouraged to stick with the tutorials in the order below as even though the provider may change, the hamlet content covered will build on those prior. The skills developed will remain applicable to all hamlet providers and frameworks.
